# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Prediction-using-Python-and-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Python and Scikit-learn. This model analyzes concentrations of various pollutants like CO, Ozone, and NO2 to forecast air quality, providing a practical tool for environmental monitoring.
# üåç Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Python

This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using Python and Machine Learning techniques.  
It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building** to forecast AQI levels, which helps in assessing environmental conditions and public health risks.

## üìå Project Overview
- Predict AQI based on key atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, etc.)
- Apply **data preprocessing techniques** such as handling missing values and normalization.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations.
- Train machine learning models to estimate AQI values.
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics like RMSE and R¬≤ score.
- Visualize predictions to understand model accuracy and insights.
